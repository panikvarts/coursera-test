			<h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
			<p>Our Famous Recipe Chicken is always cooked fresh, never frozen. Then it’s honey dipped, hand breaded in our special blend of herbs and spices and pressure cooked to seal in the flavor that put Lee’s on the map in the first place. We might hold on to our traditions a bit longer than others. But after one bite, you’ll see why.</p>

			<h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
			<p>Thin juicy ribbons of our gyudon beef and yellow onions are slowly simmered in a sweet and savory herb miso soy broth until it's tender, flavorful and totally irresistible. Served with our award-winning steamed rice. Highly addictive.</p>

			<h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
			<p>With about 100 different variations of sushi to choose from, each roll is crafted to treat the taste buds like royalty. Chef Justin incorporates his knowledge of sushi into each combination on the menu. Whether it’s the intricate Black Sea roll (Tuna, yellowtail, jalapeño, cucumber, avocado and cilantro with ponzu sauce and chili oil) or a simple Philly Roll, the result is beyond ordinary.</p>
